# discord-bot-tutorial
A Discord Bot tutorial using Discord.js.


# So you want to build a Discord Bot?

If you want to build a Discord Bot using JavaScript, you first need to know the syntax of the language and be fairly familiar with **Node.js** and **npm**. If you're not, I'd highly recommend learning before you go ahead and make one.

# Where do we start?

First of all we make sure we have Node.js installed on our computer. Once we have, we'll need to make a package.json file in the folder we want. To do this, we run the following commands from our Node command prompt.

> mkdir discord-bot
> cd discord-bot
> npm init

You should be prompted to enter in some details from here. If you don't know what to put in any of them, just skip.

Now we start coding. Create a file in the discord-bot directory called app.js. This is where we start putting our code. I'll finish this tutorial later bye guys.
